//! # libmapper-rs
//! 
//! libmapper is a cross-platform library for connecting data sources to synthesizers, DAWs, and other hardware or software devices.
//! It provides a simple API for creating and managing signals, devices, and mappings between them.
//! 
//! This project contains safe, idiomatic rust bindings to the libmapper C api.
//! 
//! ## Concepts
//! ### [Devices](device)
//! Libmapper operates on a shared peer-to-peer graph. A [Device](device::Device) represents a connection to this graph and is a container for signals.
//! 
//! Most libmapper code will start by creating a device and polling until it becomes ready, like so:
//! ```
//! use libmapper_rs::device::Device;
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut device = Device::create("CoolDevice");
//!     loop {
//!       device.poll_and_block(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10));
//!       if device.is_ready() {
//!          break;
//!         }
//!     }
//!     println!("Device is ready!");
//!     // create signals, maps, etc.
//! }
//! ```
